# Problem Statement
People who travels are usually asked by friends how was the trip? What they did and maybe ask for the itinerary. People can share some pictures on facebook but the location of the place of interest may not be clear.

# Overview
Journy allows users to posts pictures and feeds as a trip. They can then share that trip with their friends using one link. The unique feature about Journy is that users can plan their trip with their friends trip. They can create a trip planner and add parts of their friends' trip to their own plan.

This app is tied to Skyscanner plane information api as well. Users can book their flights in the trip planner as well.
